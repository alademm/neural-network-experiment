# neural-network-experiment
This is a simple neural network implementation in C++11 meant as a personal exercise after following Michael Nielsen great book (http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com). A sample running MNIST classification can be found at nn_test.cpp, you'll need to download the original dataset to run it.
